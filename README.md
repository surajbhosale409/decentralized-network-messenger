        protocols and messenger application also.

        according to work. [Separation of concerns]
        I have provided a library for Sockets in C, Library is for making sockets in C easy to use.
        And I have implemented whatsappARP protocol tobe executed as daemon [server] process. It is 
        executed by systemd at the time of booting up the operating system.
